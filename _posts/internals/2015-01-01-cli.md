The CLI sapi is the default sapi. It is called by `do_exec()` in `/src/main/commands/exec.c`. It checks the argument 
list for a file to load. Loads it, converts it to bytecode.

Then it will start up the VM through `vm_init()` with the runmode `VM_RUNMODE_CLI`. However, when we have specified 
the debug flag `-d` on the command line, the `VM_RUNMODE_DEBUG` will be added too (it's a bitwise-flag or'ed with the 
runmode). This allows the VM to start debugging.
 
We create (as usual) a context, codeblock and stackframe and execute that frame. Once finished, we destroy everything 
and exit.
