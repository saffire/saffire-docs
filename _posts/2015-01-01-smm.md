# Saffire Memory Manager
At this moment, there is no real memory manager that takes care of memory management. There is no real reason for it now, however, we might need it later on.

This is why there are `smm_*` functions that deal with this, which can be found in `src/components/general/smm.c`. It defines functions like `smm_malloc()`, `smm_free()` etc, which internally just call `malloc()` and `free()`.

A nice feature is that we can easily see how much memory we are internall using (we can keep books through smm_malloc etc). We could even create different groups for allocation: for instance, buffers, strings, objects, generic etc, so we have a nice overview on how much memory we use on strings, how much on creating objects, how much on using (memory) buffers etc.

Make sure you always use the `smm_malloc()` function instead of `malloc()`. Some C functions will use `malloc()` internally to create buffers. On those occasions either must duplicate the buffer into a `smm_malloc()` one, or just deal with the fact that we miss some memory in our bookkeeping later on.

The SMM_* functionality also means we can easily create our own custom (slab) allocator later on.
