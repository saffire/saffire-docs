<p>This documentation is for both myself and others to get an impression on how Saffire works internally.
</p>

<h2>Table of Contents</h2>

{% endfor %}
</ul>


<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>I try to be consistent with the terminology through these readings. To make things a bit clearer, here are a few of the terms I will use regularly.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Core</dt>
  <dd>With the Saffire core I mean everything that is written in C. For instance, the VM is part of the core, so is the string class and the numerical class.</dd>
  
  <dt>Userland</dt>
  <dd>Anything that is not in the core. For instance, any class you write in Saffire code will be userland. The Saffire webserver, although bundled with Saffire, is a userland application, as it is written in Saffire.</dd>
  
  <dt>Object</dt>
  <dd>Many elements within the Saffire core are internally represented by objects. Objects in this context has got nothing to do with Object Oriented Programming. Within Saffire userland, I will try and talk about classes and instances so there is no confusing with core objects.</dd>
